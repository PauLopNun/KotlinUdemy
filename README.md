## Course Description  

This course is for anyone who wants to be a Kotlin programmer from scratch. We will start by discussing all the programming fundamentals that you need to start programming in Kotlin.  

We will begin by installing the development environment, then you will run your first Kotlin app and understand how program flow works in Kotlin.  

After that, we will talk about variables, math operations, and priorities. Then we will cover logic and decision-making, followed by loops.  

We will also cover how to work with files, functions, and OOP concepts that you need when programming apps with Kotlin. Then we will discuss collections and which type of collection you should use for better performance depending on your app.  

You will also learn about multiprocessing and how you can run multiple processes at the same time.  

Then you will learn how to build apps and games in Android like Pokémon and Tic Tac Toe, and work with RESTful web services and JSON by building apps like Get Sunshine Time.  

Additionally, you will learn how to work with SQLite databases to add, delete, and update records. You will also learn how to use Firebase for online gaming and to build a social media app like Twitter.  

Finally, you will learn how to build apps with sensors, such as playing music when the light is on or Nimbuzz vibrating when the phone is shaken, and much more.
